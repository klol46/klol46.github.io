## Hyperlinks
One important feature of your site will be hyperlinks. The general format for links is [text for link](address.of.link). So, to link to my favorite tool for data science, I’d use [this](google.com).

## Linking Pages
Your website usually has more than one page. These pages can be created using the same process as index.html: create an Rmd file and knit to html. Once you have another page (e.g. about.html) you need to link to it from your home page (e.g. using use [about](about.html)), or no one will be able to find it.

## Inserting Media
Sometimes you want to add images – pictures you’ve taken or found on the internets, rather than things that are generated from analyses. This is a bit more involved than other things you might want to do. RMD’s default image settings (using ![](image.jpg)) aren’t great. I often use a line of HTML:

```{r}
<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">
```

# _site.yml

Right now, all our pages have styling, output, and structure coming from page-specific YAML. It’s better to have one set of rules that apply site-wide instead. To do this, we’ll create a single file with all the YAML stuff we need, and at the same time remove extraneous YAML header content from individual Rmd files.

Create your _site.yml file by going to File > New File > Text file. Copy the content below, and save the file as _site.yml in your project’s home folder.

## Nav Bar
There are several ways you can arrange the nav bar (right vs. left; single pages vs. drop-down menus) but the idea is to give a way to navigate through your site, not just your page. 

## Icons 
The two icons are there to encourage good practices – an easy way for someone to email you, and a link to the source for the site on GitHub (icons come from font awesome). I’ve also included an “About” page, which is pretty common for pages describing projects.
